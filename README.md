# GaloisFieldCalculator

Given 3 polynomial inputs A(x), B(x) and an irreducible polynomial P(x),
this is a program that performs the following operations in Galois Fields:

1. Addition         A(x) + B(x)
2. Subtraction      A(x) - B(x)
3. Multiplication   A(x) * B(x)
4. Division         A(x) / B(x)

The polynomials must be enterred as decimal coefficients separated by spaces.
For instance, A(x) = x^3+7x+6 is enterred as: 1 0 7 6.
