# GaloisFieldCalculator

Given 3 polynomail inputs A(x), B(x) and an irreducible polynomial P(x),
this is a program that performs the following operations in Galois Fields:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

The polynomials must be enterred as decimal coefficients separated by spaces.
For instance, A(x) = x^3+7x+6 is enterred as: 1 0 7 6.
